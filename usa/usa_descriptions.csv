For example, a single person with more than one primary cancer verified by a medical doctor is counted as a case report for each type of primary cancer reported. Having more than one primary cancer occurs in less than 20% of the population. The counts report the frequency of verified cancer diagnoses in the selected population and time period. Age-adjusted rates are calculated with age distribution ratios from the Year 2000 ""standard million"" population. An age-adjusted rate is a weighted average of the age-specific (crude) rates, where the weights are the proportions of persons in the corresponding age groups of a standard million population. The potential confounding effect of age is reduced when comparing age-adjusted rates computed using the same standard million population.","U. S.

Crude rates are helpful in determining the need for services for a given population, relative to another population, regardless of size. Crude rates are influenced by the underlying age distribution of the state's population. Even if two states have the same age-adjusted rates, the state with the relatively older population (as demonstrated by having a higher median age) will have higher crude rates because incidence or death rates for most cancers increase with increasing age.","U.
